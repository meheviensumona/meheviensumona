### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Royal University of Dhaka (RUD), specializing in web development technologies. With hands-on experience in creating  projects using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (including jQuery), and PHP, I am dedicated to perfecting my skills in these technologies.

Currently, I am sharpening my expertise in building responsive and interactive web applications using Bootstrap for frontend design, and employing JavaScript along with jQuery for dynamic client-side functionalities.

I am enthusiastic about collaborating on open-source projects and group endeavors within the web development domain, aiming to contribute to innovative solutions and further expand my proficiency in these technologies.
